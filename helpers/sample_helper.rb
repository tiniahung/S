    # This is a helper ...
    # These will be included automatically in the main application 
    # code
    # It's a good way to keep your code organized
    # if you have functions for an application or for the bot
    # you can drop them in here.
    # e.g.
    
    def some_method_for_my_bot 
      # do stuff
    end
